# CS3099 Frontend.
For the love of god don't `npm eject`.

## Project Structure.

This project structure is based off the [Fractal design](https://hackernoon.com/fractal-a-react-app-structure-for-infinite-scale-4dab943092af).


# Running the frontend.

## Install dependencies

By default, dependencies were installed when this application was generated. Whenever dependencies in `package.json` are
changed, run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

## Run!

React comes with a development mode, which is how the frontend is usually served since production speed is not a concern 
at this scale.

```sh
npm run start
```
